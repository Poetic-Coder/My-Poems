Dear younger self, 
I don’t have much to tell you. You are not the listening kind, anyway. So, I would spare you all the lectures about how you need to dream big, work hard, earn money and be successful in life. I am here to tell you the opposite. You do not have to slog your way into adulthood. No, please. Don’t do that. You are good enough just the way you are, so good in fact, you don’t need the screwed up adult version to tell you otherwise.
And, the guy you want to date so badly now? Go for it. Don’t look for a warning here. I am not going to tell you who you will end up with. Because this way, you will make more space for freedom than regrets. You will make more space for kindness than love. There is no guarantee that people will not leave. They will. Sometimes you will leave them too. You will have different choices to make, each of them coming with consequences of their own. You are only responsible for the ones you make. We are just people. People change. Allow it. Accept it and you will grow from there.  
Yours, 
You. 
Journey to 24....
