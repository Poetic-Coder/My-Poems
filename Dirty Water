You must remember what it’s like
washing clothes in a huge basia;
you don’t drink it, you don’t reuse it
you don’t keep it, hoping one day it
turns into juice or lemonade
you find the nearest gutter
and pour out the dirty water.
Forget him woman, pour him out 
out of your mind like dirty water
he’s not thinking of you
he won’t love you back.
