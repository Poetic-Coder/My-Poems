I loved him.
Every part of me belonged to him only.
My heart yearned to connect with his.
My soul felt secured in his embrace.

Then, the stars fell.
The moon went down.
The sun turned dark.
The waves drowned the ship.

He left.
He opened the door and walked away.
He didn't look back.
He broke the chains that held our souls together.

I crashed.
I broke.
I wailed.
I sulked.

But, I got back up.
Resilient.
Determined.
Optimistic I'll find ANOTHER one.

And I will.

For in this life, nothing is permanent.
