WHEN I HAVE A DAUGHTER

When I have a daughter
I'll school her to be keen
And treat her like a queen
With both theoretical & practical demonstrations; As mummyâ€™s girl
She'll have my ears, & I hers too. .

When I have a daughter
I'll let her know that her worth
Lies not in the span of her hips
The colour of her skin or lips
Nor her value, on her breasts size.
I'll guide her to brew wisdom
From the fountain of her lips
And give her sound, practical tips
On how to keenly detect a cheat
By deciphering the code of his lips.
And how to undress the lies
Encoded in a his lustful eyes. .

When I have a daughter
I'll show her how a victorious woman
Treats her man by the way
I respectably treat mine, her father;
Setting worthy examples each day
& as would be reflected in the moral
& disciplined life of her brother(s);
I'll show her the temporal charm
Unleashed by a pretentious life. .

When I have a daughter
I'll teach her to shield herself
From traps, in the hidden shelf
of societal stereotyping & its scorn
Lest she yields to its deception.
I'll teach her to wield the weapon
Of a rare kind of healthy wisdom
That enables a wise woman to win
The quotidian wars of life & living. .

When I have a daughter
I'll teach her to learn to hearken
To wise counsel, be it from a fool
She must by none ever be taken for granted;
at home or in school.
I'll tell her never to let mediocrity
Dampen the beam light of excellence
Depths of insight by her, with alacrity
Must be sought, with full confidence. .

When I have a daughter
I'll teach her to walk
Head tall, shoulders high;
Her head must not be bowed
Before any crowd of men;
Of herself she must be proud
Walking with a noble carriage
Thus commanding the admiration
Of all; I'll show her that marriage
is in itself not a fulfilment of purpose
Nor is it a dream to be pursued
She'll learn never to presuppose
Or take things at just a face value;
Look to no man for validation
Nor cower before his intimidation.
