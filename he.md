HE ( dedicated to the only man my heart yearns for everyday)

He lights up my face like the transfiguration.
Spreads me wide like an easel on canvas.
Strips me bare with the midnight blue slittering
under his nails.
Paints across the landscape of my ethereal
body exposing my nude soul.
His passion is relentless- his plea is a private
invitation to a religion I never knew existed.
His love is a psalm on my lips.

He does to me what knowledge does
to the mind.
Feeds my curiosity, ameliorates my
vocabulary and edifies me greatly as a scholar.
Wide open- he lays my spine on the table like
a book and goes down on meâ€¦
giving me mental orgasms.
Educating and enlightening me.

See, I was just a disciple of heart break-
drifting in the arms of borrowed men.
Carrying my experiences around like a crucifix.
A daughter of pain painted with the
abrasions of disappointment on my skin.
Offering myself on the altar of deception as
a sacrificial lamb for a plate of passion.
Tracing the insecurities of men on the
heels of their feet.
Following the foot prints of conflict-
drowning in the sea of consciousness.
Love was just a sperm in the womb of
my mind.
Conception was made with the genesis
of this magnificent adoration.
Like a prophesy, his love for me ushered
in a wave of sweet epiphanies.
He pulled me out of the pit of self loathing
and regret.
His manifestation of authenticity legitimized
my life.
His humanity glorified my existence and
re-affirmed my purpose.

He is more of a poetâ€™s muse and an artistâ€™s
inspiration.
Drops of adulation squirt from my veins as
we cuddle at the navel of midnight as he
warms the night oil.
He is a glance of God at dawnâ€™s prestige
you seeâ€¦
The voice of reason stifled by the heart break of quiet eloquence.
My 90s mix tape when I want to do the jitterbug
or the running man
My poetic metaphor at the burst of creativity.
That Popsicle on a hot day.
The essence of maturity.
Loving him feels like popping a soap bubble
after a long hot day.

He makes my heart beat to the sound of the
African drum at dawn when the ants pack up
for the day and the crickets prepare for a
musical concert.
Stupefied! I am helpless in his tenacity.
Taking mental dictation each time his smooth
baritone voice croons a soul jam.
Lyrical scripting to my heart in a parable
of lyrical uprisings!
His words laid out like a treble, beats and
rhythms communicating emotions.
Brother takes me through forgotten seas
with forever anchored at the dock.
We ride on the milky way with marriage
looking sharp on the horizon.

He turned heart-break into day-break.
And right now, he is the essence of my
poetic addiction.
