BOYS ARE STONES, SO SOCIETY SAID?????
****************************************
Have you been to the mind of that boy child, tell me
what did you see........

Did you see little boys struggling to stay sane on the
streets of Jos as they hawked plantain chips from
Terminus to gada biu just to feed four siblings and a sick
mother laying bedridden at home....

Boys are stones so society said????....

Did you see how mama Ishaya burnt Yakubu's back
with hot iron because two pieces of yam that went
missing from her pot that night after he came back
without selling any of the wares he had hawked through
of that day...

Are boys really made from stones???.....

What did you see when you went down the
memory lane the other day, there, in the corners of
Angwan-rukuba and Buss-buji, did you not see how Bulus called to
you for help to rescue him from those bloody thugs
as they inserted their yam sized dicks into his anus in
a way to satisfy their sexual escapades on that innocent
boy that knows nothing about being gay...

They called us stones, but what are we really????......

Look closely at bankole corpse , can you still recognize
him from the charred remains after he was lynched at
Terminus market for stealing an apple from that fruit shop
because he was starving after a long day without pay...

BOYS ARE STONES; so society said for they constantly
abuse the boy child and expect a smile in return...
When you look into the yellow stained eyes of that boy
child on the street what did you see again...

Beneath this thick shrouds of muscles and carefully
bounded tissues is a boy searching for answers in a
society filled with lies, gobbledygook and hogwash
stories that the boy child my imbibe...

Have you seen the lies society pumps into our system,
they used us as Guinea pigs to further their cause..

Look into the eyes of that boy child again and tell me what
do you see,

is it an animal you see or a boy child waiting to be found
we are lonely souls walking the earth confused and stranded
in this perpetual state of limbo not knowing what comes next
or which way leads home..

Boys are stones, so they said, but we bleed too and we cry
in secret when no one is watching our hearts are not made
of stones and rivers of emotions dwell in our hearts just as
they dwell in yours too...

Boys are not stones but society has told lies about us from
the very beginning....
